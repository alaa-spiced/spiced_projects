1. input (text field)
   
	* loop through list of countries and add each country that starts with the current value of the text field to an array
   
	* edge case: if value of the text field is an empty string, do not make a list of matches and hide/empty any results you are currently showing
   
	* if the list of matches has more than four items in it, reduce it to four. (alternatively, in the loop `break` once the length of the matches array
	 reaches four)
   
	* if the list of matches is empty, set the html of your results container to contain a "no results" message
   
	* if the the list of matches is not empty, loop through the matches, create html for each result, and finally put the html into the 
	results container

	* remove highlight class from the element that has it (if any)
   
	* add highlight class to the target of the event



3. mousedown (individual result)
   
	* set the value of the text field to be the text of the target of the event
   
	* hide/empty the results



4. keydown (text field)
   
	* if the key is the down arrow
     
		- if no result has highlight class, add highlight class to the first result
     
		- if any result except the last result has the highlight class, remove the highlight class from the one that has it and add it to the next one
     
		- if the last result has the highlight class, do nothing
  
 
	* if the key is the up arrow
   
		- if no result has highlight class, add highlight class to the last result
     
		- if any result except the first result has the highlight class, remove the highlight class from the one that has it and add it
		  to the previous one
     
		- if the first result has the highlight class, do nothing
   

	* if the key is enter/return
    
		- set the value of the text field to be the text of the result that currently has the highlight class 
     
		- hide/empty results
