People probably <a href="http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/">shouldn't use carousels</a> on their websites but they do anyway. The odds are good that and sooner or later someone will ask you to make one. Fortunately, they can be fun to make. So let's make one!

<img src="carousel.gif">

* Use <a href="assets">these four assets</a>
* The height of the carousel area should be 600px
* The carousel should fill the browser horizontally
* Each image should stay on screen for 5 seconds before sliding off
* Use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions">CSS transitions</a> for the animation effect
* The dots are just indicators and are not navigation

### Part 2

The dots should be clickable. When a user clicks a dot that is not lit up, the corresponding image slides in from the right. The image should slide in from the right even if its dot is to the left of the one that was lit up when the user clicks.

### Bonus Part 3

* 600px is too tall for most phones. Make the carousel fill the screen on phones in either orientation.
* Allow users with touch screens to trigger the transition by swiping
